# ITEC3170 Project Documentation



## Dataset Selection
- Hypothesis: The EV market has grown more over the last decade in developed countries than those not considered as developed.
- Problem Statement: This projects aims to analyze a public dataset on EV records over the past decade which include its growing market share, sales, charging points, etc. to determine whether being a developed/underdeveloped country has influence over its growth
- Global EV Sales: 2010-2024
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024
- Description: Global EV Data: 2010-2024, with some predictions for 2025-2035 (China, North America, Other (grouped regions) and the World).
- Why This dataset?: With emerging technologies like AI and self driving capabilities, the EV world generates interest in me on how the automotive market has changed in the last decade.

## Dataset manipulation
- Downloading the dataset using curl: My dataset is from kaggle, which requires authentication before downloading from the site, so you can't directly download from it.Instead I used the following commands after manually downloading

git add GlobalEVSales2024.csv
git commit -m "Added EV sales dataset"
git push origin main.

-Inspect the data using head: The following code was entered with the following results

head -5 GlobalEVSales2024.csv
region,category,parameter,mode,powertrain,year,unit,value
Australia,Historical,EV stock share,Cars,EV,2011,percent,0.000390000001062
Australia,Historical,EV sales share,Cars,EV,2011,percent,0.00650000013411
Australia,Historical,EV sales,Cars,BEV,2011,Vehicles,49
Australia,Historical,EV stock,Cars,BEV,2011,Vehicles,49

With there being only 8 columns, which are not that many, I would like to keep the dataset as is to not lose any potential relevant information down the line.

- awk command to gather initial data:

 awk -F ',' '{count[$1]++} END {for (val in count) print val, count[val]}' GlobalEVSales2024.csv

When performing this awk command to count instances of the unique values in column 1 which is 'region', we can see how developed countries have more entries or records within the dataset, than those countries not considered as developed. Example, if we compare the 'USA' entries at 737, against 'Costa Rica' which only accounts for 27 records. We can clearyl see tha disparity and how there have not been many EV data points in this country over the last decade.
