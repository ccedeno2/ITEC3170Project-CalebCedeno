# ITEC3170 Project Documentation



## Dataset Selection
- Hypothesis: The EV market has grown more over the last decade in developed countries than those developing countries.
- Developed Country: Characterized by high quality of life, developed economy, and advanced technological infrastructure compared to less industrialized nations, often measured by GDP. eg: United States, Canada, Japan, many countries in Europe, and Australia.
- Problem Statement: This projects aims to analyze a public dataset on EV records over the past decade which include its growing market share, sales, charging points, etc. to determine whether being a developed/underdeveloped country has influence over its growth
- Global EV Sales: 2010-2024
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024
- Description: Global EV Data: 2010-2024, with some predictions for 2025-2035 (China, North America, Other (grouped regions) and the World).
- Why This dataset?: With emerging technologies like AI and self driving capabilities, the EV world generates interest in me on how the automotive market has changed in the last decade.

## Dataset manipulation
- Downloading the dataset using curl: My dataset is from kaggle, which requires authentication before downloading from the site, so you can't directly download from it.Instead I used the following commands after manually downloading

git add GlobalEVSales2024.csv
git commit -m "Added EV sales dataset"
git push origin main.

-Inspect the data using head: The following code was entered with the following results

head -5 GlobalEVSales2024.csv
region,category,parameter,mode,powertrain,year,unit,value
Australia,Historical,EV stock share,Cars,EV,2011,percent,0.000390000001062
Australia,Historical,EV sales share,Cars,EV,2011,percent,0.00650000013411
Australia,Historical,EV sales,Cars,BEV,2011,Vehicles,49
Australia,Historical,EV stock,Cars,BEV,2011,Vehicles,49

With there being only 8 columns, which are not that many, I would like to keep the dataset as is to not lose any potential relevant information down the line.

- awk command to gather initial data:

 awk -F ',' '{count[$1]++} END {for (val in count) print val, count[val]}' GlobalEVSales2024.csv

## Analyisis
When performing this awk command to count instances of the unique values in column 1 which is 'region', we can see how developed countries have more entries or records within the dataset, than those countries not considered as developed. Example, if we compare the 'USA' entries at 737, against 'Costa Rica' which only accounts for 27 records. We can clearly see the disparity and how there have not been many EV data points in this country over the last decade.

Let's see some more examples. Canada with 247 entries, Finland 200, Denmark 319, all triple digits. Compared against Colombia with 27 entries, Cyprus at 14, Seychelles 18. We can clearly see triple digit records for developed countries when examples of developing or underdeveloped countries have double digit entries at best.

I wanted to see the sales history for a developed country, in this case Canada, so I did the following awk command to filter the data and show me the values:

awk -F ',' 'BEGIN { print "region,parameter,year,value" } $1 == "Canada" && $3 == "EV sales" { print $1 "," $3 "," $6 "," $8 }' GlobalEVSales2024.csv

We can clearly see the trend being an upward shift in sales from 2010 with 1 sales data point for value '1', compared to 2023 with multiple EV sales data points adding to over 180,000+ sales.

Lets compare it to Chile, which is one of the most developed in Latin America but still considered developing country:

awk -F ',' 'BEGIN { print "region,parameter,year,value" } $1 == "Chile" && $3 == "EV sales" { print $1 "," $3 "," $6 "," $8 }' GlobalEVSales2024.csv

Chile,EV sales,2011,6

Chile,EV sales,2022,1
Chile,EV sales,2022,620
Chile,EV sales,2023,510

We can see the difference in data points for each year, as well as compare 2023 EV sales numbers which in this case total up to 920 only.

## Problems with Hadoop
I'm having major issues doing the requested with Hadoop. Instead I used python with  pandas for basic data processing due to my dataset not being extremely large.

I created a Python process_ev_sales.py script
